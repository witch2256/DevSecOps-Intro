# Lab 3 - Submission

## Task 1: SSH Commit Signing

### Local configuration
- `git config --global gpg.format` -> `ssh`
- `git config --global user.signingkey` -> `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- `git config --global commit.gpgsign` -> `true`

### Local verification
Output of `git log --show-signature -1`:

### One-paragraph reflection
If an attacker can forde a commit author, they can inject malicious code and later deny having done so, causing confusion and undermining thust in the codebase. Signed commits protect the team from both external impersonation and internal disputes about who introduced a change.

### Tune-out exercise

1. **Inline allowlist** – can be added to the `.gitleaks.toml`, block `[allowlist]` This is appropriate if you know for sure the string is a test inclusion, but dangerous because you ca naccidentallu publish a real secret.

2. **Path exclusion** – can be chenged`docs/`,to gitleaks not check files there. This is risky because the documentation may also require keys to be specified. Better to use whitelist with provided strings rather than checking entire directories.
